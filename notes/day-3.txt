1. HTML [designing]
2. CSS [styling]
3. JavaScript [scripting language]
4. DOM [DOM library is part of browser and the definition of the following objects and methods are supplied to JS engine when JS engine compiles and executes the JS code]
		=> document object and getElementById method
		=> window object and alert method
		=> console object and log, warn, info, error methods

5. web protocols: HTTP, FTP, HTTPS (HTTP with SSL)


HTML:
	block level and inline elements

CSS:
	a. inline styling
	b. outline but in-file styling using style tag	
	c. external stylesheet and linking the same using <link> tag with HTML


JavaScript:
	a. write JS code inside HTML file using <script> tag
	b. write JS code in separate JS file and link the same using <script src='path-of-js-file'></script> tag with HTML file

DOM:
	DOM manipulation code is written in JavaScript code, whereas the definition of the DOM objects and their methods are supplied to JS engine when JS engine compiles and executes the JS code

Roadmap:
-----------------------------
HTML and HTML5 
CSS3 and bootstrap
JS and DOM
jQuery
Node JS and NPM

Web standards and Best practices
	- responsive
	- uniform across the devices
	- design should be meaningful


HTML5:
	a. DOCTYPE
	b. meta tag
		i. with charset attribute
		Note: the meta tag with charset attribute should be the first tag in <head> element
		Extra info: what is encoding? different types of encoding format
	  referr: Javatpoint
		ii. with description 
		iii. with viewport
		questions: what does it mean by width=device-width?
						 what does it mean by initial-scale=1.0?
		Best practices:
		1. Do NOT use large fixed width elements - For example, if an image is displayed at a width wider than the viewport it can cause the viewport to scroll horizontally. Remember to adjust this content to fit within the width of the viewport.

2. Do NOT let the content rely on a particular viewport width to render well - Since screen dimensions and width in CSS pixels vary widely between devices, content should not rely on a particular viewport width to render well.

3. Use CSS media queries to apply different styling for small and large screens - Setting large absolute CSS widths for page elements will cause the element to be too wide for the viewport on a smaller device. Instead, consider using relative width values, such as width: 100%. Also, be careful of using large absolute positioning values. It may cause the element to fall outside the viewport on small devices.


	iv. with keywords:
	The keyword value is also used to provide keywords for a search engine, but it may ignore by browser due to spammers.

	Note: what is SEO?
	SEO stands for “search engine optimization.” In simple terms, it means the process of improving your site to increase its visibility when people search for products or services related to your business in Google, Bing, and other search engines. The better visibility your pages have in search results, the more likely you are to garner attention and attract prospective and existing customers to your business.

	v. with http-equiv:
	<meta http-equiv="content-security-policy|content-type|default-style|refresh">
	q: what is http-quiv?
	q: what are possible values of http-equiv attribute as well as corresponding content attribute values?


c. base tag
possible values of target attribute:
_self: Load the result into the same browsing context as the current one. This value is the default if the attribute is not specified.
_blank: Load the result into a new unnamed browsing context.
_parent: Load the result into the parent browsing context of the current one. If there is no parent, this option behaves the same way as _self.
_top: Load the result into the top-level browsing context (that is, the browsing context that is an ancestor of the current one, and has no parent). If there is no parent, this option behaves the same way as _self.
Note: If this (target) attribute is specified, this element (base) must come before any other elements with attributes whose values are URLs.
